# Weather Application

## Desctiption

This is my new application for displaying current weather and weather forecast as well. I developed this project to learn how to work with web API, to understand how destructurisation in ES6 works. I also used some regex in this project.

- #### Technologies
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Web API
  - Pure JavaScript(not using modules)

* #### Programming paradigm
  Functional programming
* #### App features

  On this page you can see a weather dashboard with some parameters of current weather.

  1. The application asks for your permission to get your location. So this is the first feature: your town can be searched automatically. You can also do it by yourself by clicking the geolocation button.
  2. You can change the city. By clicking the city name you open a popup with input for a city name. You may cancel the changing.
  3. At the main board with the city name you can see forecast bar with hourly forecast. You can click on to any hour to display forecast on other blocks too.
  4. There are also some animations depending on condition, time of the day and position of the sun.

* #### Deployment
  You can try using my app by the following link: https://evgenii-buslaev.github.io/WeatherApp/

Thank you for checking the app out!
